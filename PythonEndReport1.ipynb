    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created to show an overview of language syntax and functions learned during the course. I used Python 3 for coding. Python is an open-source coding language with the potential for high user customization and freely available. Jupyter Notebooks were chosen for the report because they allowed for both coding and text portions interweaved with one another. The reader is able to run coding boxes when desired and make changes and re-run to see how things are affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interactive notebook where the reader can choose which code they would like to output. To output a cell's code, **hold CTRL and press ENTER**. This will run the code in that cell only. Code can also be altered by the reader and rerun with the new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some code is defined in a previous cell and then referenced later. If the first cell is not run, the later cell will result in an error because what it is referencing had not yet been defined. To avoid this pitfall, the user can select on the top toolbar, **Cell - Run All**."
