# Attempt

This repo was created to hold the final report for my Python independent study at the Milwaukee School of Engineering.

The final report was created as a Jupyter Notebook. It is made to be easy to read without interaction.

However, if you would prefer to run the code in the notebook, the easiest way to run this notebook in your browser is to download Anaconda with Python 3.x

Anaconda comes packaged with any requirements needed in my final report. Once it is finished downloading, select to open Jupyter Notebooks and navigate to this repo to run the notebook.
